# Notification System Design

This repository outlines the design and implementation details for a robust Notification System. The system is designed to handle various types of notifications, prioritize them based on urgency, and deliver them through multiple channels.

## Components

### 1. Notification Service
The core component responsible for processing and prioritizing notifications. Exposes REST APIs for client communication and handles notification scheduling.

### 2. Notification Template Service
Manages templates for different notification types, ensuring consistent formatting. Fetches required templates based on notification types.

### 3. User Selection Service
Provides functionality for selecting target users based on various criteria. Supports scenarios for sending bulk messages to specific user segments.

### 4. User Profile Service
Manages user profiles and preferences. Allows users to subscribe, unsubscribe, and set notification receiving frequency.

### 5. Notification Database Service
Responsible for storing notification messages, delivery time, and status. Implements CRUD operations for efficient data management.

### 6. Event Hub/Message Queue Service
Integrates a message queue system for asynchronous communication between components. Defines topics for different priority queues.

### 7. Retry Mechanism
Handles retry attempts for failed notifications, implementing a backoff strategy and utilizing retry queues. A Dead Letter Topic aids in capturing known failures.

### 8. Rate Limiter
Controls the flow of incoming requests, preventing overload. Incorporates a caching mechanism to store and check rate-limiting information.

### 9. Notification Adapters
Transforms messages from the event hub to external vendor-supported formats. Specific adapters are developed for OTP, SMS, Email, In-App, WhatsApp, and Telegram.

### 10. Notification Vendors Integration
Integrates with external SAAS vendors for actual notification transmission. Vendor-specific integration services are developed for SMS, Email, App Push, WhatsApp, and Telegram.

## Usage
